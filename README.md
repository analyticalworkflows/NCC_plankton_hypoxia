This repository contains the code for the analyses for the first chapter of my (Elena Conser) dissertation. 


### Repository Content 
Statistical analyses were performed in R *v4.4.1*  
See `README_packages.md` for all required packages and versions utilized in this analysis.

**code** 

Within the code subdirectory, there is a separate md document that describes all processing and statistical analysis scripts.
